# ADR 0025: Open the second gate for the extended state enable

## Status

Accepted.

## Decision

Admit `kernel-read-cr4` (arity 0), `kernel-write-cr4` (1) and `kernel-xsetbv`
(2) at all four places this file states a privileged operation:

1. the membership set in `verify-expr!` — otherwise they fall to the terminal
   `:else` with `"runtime KIR operation rejected"`;
2. the **independently re-derived** arity map beside it;
3. `kernel-native-operations`, which decides whether the oracle re-executes an
   entry;
4. the set that requires the aiueos kernel target, so no other target can name
   them.

## Why all four, when three would compile

ADR 0023 recorded that `kernel-xgetbv` had been landed in kotoba-gmir,
kotoba-kir, kotoba-sema and kotoba-native and **not here**, and that nothing
found it until a `.kotoba` program called it. The write half of the same feature
check arriving late for the same reason would be a pattern rather than an
accident, so it is opened here in the same change.

Each of the four is a different failure:

- missing from (1): every call is refused with a message that names nothing;
- wrong in (2): a wrong arity **does not crash**. A one-argument
  `kernel-xsetbv` takes the VALUE as the XCR index and writes EDX:EAX from
  whatever the register happened to hold — into the register that governs
  whether the machine saves its vector state across a context switch;
- missing from (3): the disagreement with `kotoba.kir/lower` surfaces in
  neither side's terms. The compiler correctly seals no value, this side
  re-executes the entry, gets `:kernel-privileged-unavailable`, and refuses the
  artifact as an oracle mismatch it never had;
- missing from (4): a non-aiueos target could name x86 machine state.

## The arity map is re-derived, not imported

That is the whole point of this table, and `kernel-xsetbv` is the clearest case
it has: `2` here is arrived at independently of kotoba-sema's `2`. If the two
ever disagree, the negative rows in the test say so in this repository's own
words.

## There is no `kernel-write-cr2`

CR2 is written by the CPU when a page fault is taken. The test asserts that
`(kernel-write-cr2 p0)` is refused with `"runtime KIR operation rejected"` —
the terminal `:else` — rather than leaving the absence implicit.

## The kotoba-native pin was NOT bumped, and that is measured

This repository's `deps.edn` comment says a pin that refuses what the verifier
admits "would put the disagreement inside this repo's own closure", so bumping
to kotoba-native `da3593b5` (which carries the encodings) was attempted.

It imports **22 failing assertions in two tests** —
`pinned-producer-lazily-spills-only-the-fifth-entry-argument` and
`pinned-producer-materializes-only-the-live-across-call-value` — that have
nothing to do with these operators. Measured three ways:

| kotoba-native pin | result |
|---|---|
| `a2023fed` (this repo's pin, kept) | 68 tests / 440 assertions, **0 failures** |
| `24f43e2` (kotoba-native main *before* the xsave change) | 22 failures, same two tests |
| `da3593b5` (kotoba-native main *with* it) | 22 failures, same two tests |

The middle row is the answer: the failures are a register-allocator change
already on kotoba-native main, not this one. They belong to whoever made that
change. Bumping here would land a red suite for someone else's reason, so the
pin stays and this paragraph exists instead of silence.

**What the stale pin does and does not cost.** It is inert for the compiler:
amu pins kotoba-native itself, and tools.deps resolves one version per
classpath, so `verify-native-artifact!` re-emits with amu's newer backend. It
costs exactly one thing — this repository cannot, on its own classpath, verify
an artifact that uses these operators. Nothing here tries to.

## Evidence

`kotoba.verifier-test/the-extended-state-enable-is-admitted-at-its-three-arities`
— five positive rows (including literal operands, the shape a real enable has),
six negative rows pinning
`"runtime KIR kernel privileged operation arity rejected"`, three
oracle-suppression assertions, and the CR2 negative.

Shown to discriminate twice, with different messages:

| break | failure |
|---|---|
| remove the three from the membership set | `"runtime KIR operation rejected"` — the terminal `:else`, which is exactly the shape ADR 0023 describes |
| change `kernel-xsetbv` arity to 1 | the two-argument positives fail with the arity message, and the one-argument negative stops being negative (`nil`) |

Restored: 68 tests / 440 assertions, 0 failures.

Nothing here executes.
