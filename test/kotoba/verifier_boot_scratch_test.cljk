  "boot-scratch: the writable region and the address of a function, verified
  independently of the frontend.

  What is worth verifying differs between the two. `kernel-scratch-region`
  has an ARITY and nothing else -- a one-argument spelling would walk an
  operand nothing reads. `kernel-function-address` has a NAME, and the name
  is the only thing in it that can be wrong: the argument is not walked (it
  is source text, not an expression), so nothing else stands between a
  misspelling and a backend `lea` at a label it would have to invent."
