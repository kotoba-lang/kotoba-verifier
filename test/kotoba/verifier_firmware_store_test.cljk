(ns kotoba.verifier-firmware-store-test
  "fwstore: the allocation that answers with an address, verified
  independently of the frontend.

  This verifier rejects by ABSENCE -- a head that reaches it without a row
  falls to the terminal `:else` and is refused as an unknown operation -- so
  the positive case below is the half that matters most: it is the assertion
  that a program kotoba-sema accepts is not refused here for lack of a row.
  `kernel-xgetbv` was landed in four repositories and not this one, fell to
  that `:else`, and was found by the first `.kotoba` program that called it.

  The arity is the other half, and this operation's arity is the one in the
  privileged table whose consequence is worst if it is wrong. The operand
  this file cannot see is the one that is not there: the out-pointer belongs
  to the emitted frame, so a miscounted operand list does not fail to
  compile. It shifts every argument by one and hands `AllocatePages` a page
  count that was meant to be a memory type -- and kotoba-sema has already
  certified a window over the pages on the strength of the count it read."
