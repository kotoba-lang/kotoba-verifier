(ns kotoba.verifier-kir-agreement-test
  "Two repositories maintain the same native floating-point admission list.
  This asserts they still agree, and names the heads if they do not.

  `kotoba.verifier` re-derives what native admits INDEPENDENTLY of
  `kotoba.kir/only-native-word-typed-features?`, and that independence is the
  point: being stricter than the oracle is sound, being looser is not. So this
  is a test and not a require -- nothing here makes the verifier accept an
  operation, it can only fail.

  What it removes is silent drift, which has a measured cost. On 2026-09-02 the
  f32 arm was missing from the verifier while kir admitted the family; the
  symptom was `amu check` green and `amu compile --target x86_64 --jvm-free`
  failing with `:error :verify` on the f32 dot-product example, after every
  other layer had already accepted the program. SYSOPS met the same wall from
  the other direction the same day. Neither was found by a check; both were
  found by someone compiling something.

  The two sides are:

    kir       `kotoba.kir/native-floating-point-operations` -- the union of the
              five sets `only-native-word-typed-features?` branches on
    verifier  `#'kotoba.verifier/f64-operations` and `#'.../f32-operations` --
              the two arms of `verify-expr!`

  Both are the values the code uses, not descriptions kept alongside it."
