  "`string-contains?` and `string-replace-all` pass runtime KIR verification.

  This verifier re-derives its own operation tables rather than importing
  anyone's, which is the property that makes it worth having -- and is also why
  it was, independently of `kotoba.kir`, the second of two gates refusing these
  two operations before any code could be emitted for them. Both had a lowering
  on both native ISAs from kotoba-native `5df4d85`
  (`kotoba.native.string-search`, its ADR 0002) and neither could be reached
  from source, because opening one gate leaves the other closed.

  What is pinned here is the arity contract: the two shapes with a lowering are
  admitted, every other arity is refused, and the operands are still verified."
