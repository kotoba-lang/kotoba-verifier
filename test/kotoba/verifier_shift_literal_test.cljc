(ns kotoba.verifier-shift-literal-test
  "A shift count is a guest literal, and the two compiler hosts represent a
  guest literal differently.

  On the JVM a `.kotoba` integer is a `long`. Under nbb it is a JavaScript
  `bigint` -- `kotoba.compiler.kotoba-reader` reads every integer token as one
  and `kotoba.kir` coerces every literal to one before it enters the runtime
  value stream -- and cljs `integer?` does not recognize a bigint. This
  verifier's i64 and i32 shift gates were spelled with bare `integer?`, so on
  the JDK-free route the count of EVERY shift failed the literal test and every
  such artifact was refused with `runtime KIR i64 shift count rejected`, while
  the JVM route compiled the same program. The refusal named the count, and the
  count was a perfectly good literal.

  This test is `.cljc` and runs on both hosts for that reason: the defect is
  invisible from either one alone. `guest-int` below builds the count in the
  representation the running host's reader actually produces, which is the only
  thing that makes the cljs half able to go red -- a quoted `4` inside this
  file is read by the HOST's reader as a plain cljs number, passes bare
  `integer?`, and would have been a test that could never fail.

  What is pinned is the whole rule, not just the half that was broken: counts
  in range are admitted, and a non-literal or out-of-range count is still
  refused, with the same reason literal, on both hosts."
