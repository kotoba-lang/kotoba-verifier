  "granted regions: the slice memory family on a NON-aiueos native target.

  Every operation in `kernel-memory-operations` used to require an aiueos
  kernel target, and the reason was sound -- `base` is an address and the
  emitted bounds check constrains the offset within a window, not the window
  itself. What that did not cover is a base the program could not have
  CHOSEN. `kotoba.compiler.frontend`'s region-provenance pass already requires
  every base to flow unmodified from a literal, from `kernel-boot-info`, or
  from a parameter, and already names the case that matters: a tainted
  parameter no internal call supplies is the ABI boundary where the caller
  hands the region in. On a hosted target the caller is the host.

  So this file tests the condition the verifier now attaches to that
  admission, and it re-derives it INDEPENDENTLY of the frontend -- being
  stricter here is sound, trusting the frontend's answer is not.

  ⚠ WHAT THIS FILE CANNOT SAY. It cannot say the admitted program computes
  the right number. That was measured outside this repository on 2026-09-09:
  `amu compile --target aarch64` of a module whose export takes `base` and
  `length` and folds `(slice-of-u8 base length)` was extracted with `amu
  extract-native`, assembled, and CALLED from C with a real buffer and a
  context block carrying fuel at [x7+8]. Four fixtures -- 64 bytes summing to
  2080, a granted length of 10 summing to 55, an empty region, and four 0xFF
  bytes summing to 1020 rather than to a negative -- all correct. That is the
  primitive the provider CLI's `generate!` refuses on today
  (`:kotodama/blocked-on :kotoba/bytes-access`)."
