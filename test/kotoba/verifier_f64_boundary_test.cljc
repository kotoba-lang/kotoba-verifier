  It has to open too, and independently. `kotoba.kir` deciding that a native

  what stops `amu compile --target aarch64` from answering `:error :verify`
  after every other layer already accepted the program. That exact split cost
  a day on 2026-09-02 when the f32 arm was missing here while kir admitted it,
